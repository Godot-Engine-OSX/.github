## üí° Overview  

**Godot Engine** is a fully-featured, open-source **game development platform** that enables creators to design, develop, and publish both **2D and 3D games** efficiently. Known for its flexibility and intuitive interface, Godot provides a complete set of tools for artists, programmers, and designers to bring their ideas to life ‚Äî all without licensing fees or royalties.  

Godot features a **node-based architecture**, where every element in a game ‚Äî from sprites to physics objects ‚Äî is represented as a node, allowing developers to build modular and reusable components. Its scripting language, **GDScript**, is optimized for fast and expressive game logic development, while also supporting **C#, C++**, and **VisualScript** for broader flexibility.  

The latest version, **Godot 4**, introduces a revamped **3D rendering engine**, global illumination, Vulkan support, and advanced visual effects, making it a strong contender alongside commercial engines. Additionally, its lightweight editor runs smoothly on **macOS**, offering full **cross-platform export** to Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and web browsers.  

With an active global community, extensive documentation, and constant updates, **Godot Engine** stands as one of the most accessible and powerful solutions for both indie developers and professional studios.
